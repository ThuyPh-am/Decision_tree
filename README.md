# Decision_tree
**Apple Quality classification**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook aimed at solving the classification problem of apple quality using Decision Tree algorithm.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this classification task was provided by an American agriculture company and is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality?resource=download). It was accessed on 18 February 2024. The dataset was stored in Google Drive to mount in Google Colab for ease of access.

### Inspiration

This notebook draws inspiration from the following Kaggle notebooks:

1. [Clustering KMeans with PCA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dsptlp/clustering-kmeans-with-pca)
2. [Apple Quality Classifier: RandomForest and SVM](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dedlinnn/apple-quality-classifier-randomforest-and-svm)

### Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Import Dataset**: The dataset is imported into the notebook.
2. **Explore Dataset**: Statistical information about the dataset is explored, investigating correlations among features and between features and labels.
3. **Decision Tree Classification**: Decision Tree algorithm is deployed to perform the classification task.
4. **Model Optimization**: The structure of the model is optimized by tweaking hyperparameters for improved performance.
